Fulton Proof of Concept

I want to copy some idea from Angular, like Dependency Injection, because Angular has its own compiler, so I worries some ideas like type can't works on regular nodejs. So use these projects to test out the language capabilities.

## Packages
- `fulton-core` is the shared code for client and server
- `fulton-server` is the code for server
- `fulton-example` is the server side
- `fulton-model-decorator` typescript decorator for server and client, will delete?
- `fulton-client` basic class for client
- `fulton-angular` basic class for angular based on fulton-client
- `fulton-cli` is like angular generator, to create project, files, routers (or use yo)
