Fulton Proof of Concept

I want to copy some idea from Angular, like Dependency Injection, becaues Angular has its own compiler, so I worries some ideas like type can't works on regular nodejs. So use these projects to test out.


Fulton is abstrct package
Fulton Default has some default implementations 
Fulton Example is the server side


run these command to create npm package link
```
Fulton > npm link

FultonDefault > npm link fulton
FultonDefault > npm link

FultonExample > npm link fulton, fulton-default
```

### Rename?
fulton to fulton-core?
fulton-default to fulton?
